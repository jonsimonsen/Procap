# Procap
Project for visualization of statistical data

The project is not constructed with the public in mind, so the README is not necessarily particularly descriptive. <br>
It might not make perfect sense for casual readers. <br>

Monday
------

-API ok. C <br>
-JSON parsing. Priorities. H <br>
-Skip ahead, returning to the libraries later. F <br>
-Highcharts for visualization. B <br>
-Installing framework (visualization). A couple of failed attempts (incompatibility errors and similar). <br>
Eventually opted to use the zipped version, and that seems to be working. G <br>

Tuesday
-------

-Overview of html examples from highcharts. D <br>
-Created GitHub repo. F <br>
-ISSUE: Choosing appropriate gitignore. Chose Node, since it seems like the node.js framework is involved. Is there a better base for the gitignore? C <br>
-Setting up a local clone of the repo.  D <br>
-Commiting version 0.1. <br>
-TODO: The plan is to either look more closely at Highcharts documentation and examples or to start working on a html document as the base for the visualization. 0 <br>

versions
