# Procap
Project for visualization of statistical data

The project is not constructed with the public in mind, so the README is not necessarily particularly descriptive. <br>
It might not make perfect sense for casual readers. <br>

-API ok. C <br>
-JSON parsing. Priorities. H <br>
-Skip ahead, returning to the libraries later. F <br>
-Highcharts for visualization. B <br>
-Installing framework (visualization). A couple of failed attempts (incompatibility errors and similar). <br>
Eventually opted to use the zipped version, and that seems to be working. G <br>

Tuesday
-------

-Overview of html examples from highcharts. D <br>
-Created GitHub repo. F <br>
