# Procap
Project for visualization of statistical data

The project is not constructed with the public in mind, so the README is not necessarily particularly descriptive.  
It might not make perfect sense for casual readers.  

Monday
------

-API ok. C  
-JSON parsing. Priorities. H  
-Skip ahead, returning to the libraries later. F  
-Highcharts for visualization. B  
-Installing framework (visualization). A couple of failed attempts (incompatibility errors and similar).  
Eventually opted to use the zipped version, and that seems to be working. G  

Tuesday
-------

-Overview of html examples from highcharts. D  
-Created GitHub repo. F  
-ISSUE: Choosing appropriate gitignore. Chose Node, since it seems like the node.js framework is involved. Is there a better base for the gitignore? C  
-Setting up a local clone of the repo.  D  
-Commiting version 0.1.  
-Made a basic html document for testing. B  
-Highcharts get started setup in progress. H  
-Commiting version 0.2.  

Wednesday
---------

-Looked at a tutorial on JavaScript. D  
-Got "more started" on highcharts. E  

Thursday
--------

-Fixed an error in path to local highcharts dir. Might need to change it again if uploading to the web. H  
-Refactored the README to try to use double spaces instead of br tags. B  
-Refactoring scripted functions into js-files in a new dir. E  
-Getting the scripts correctly into the html file. Resulted in renaming of the html file and discovery of a bug. G  
-Commiting version 0.3  

Friday
------
-Made script to create divs inside a div for displaying charts. Included learning basic debugging of JS. H  
-Commiting version 0.4
-Made script to enable cycling through charts. H  
-Added more comments to the code. C  
-Commiting version 0.45

versions
--------

0.1
---

-Preliminary local installation of Highcharts (ignored in repo).  
-Setup of GitHub repo with README and initial gitignore.  

0.2
---

-Made a basic html document, and populated it with data from Highcharts get started section.  

0.3
---

-More orderly and easier customizable code.  
-Possible TODO: Let the user decide the content on the page.  

0.4
---

-Made a script for placing divs inside a div. Can now change the charts by specifying another JS file without changing the html code.  
-Same TODO as 0.3. Should look into using buttons.  

0.45
----

-Made a script for cycling through charts. Will hopefully enable cycling after including a button.  
-Better commented code.  
-TODO is still the same. The button will probably try to reload or render the page again with different initial state.  
-TODO2: Remove/comment out debugging code where appropriate.
